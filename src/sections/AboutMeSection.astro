  <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">About Me</h2>
  
  <p>I'm not just another software developer; I'm a person with a story, a family, and a drive that keeps me going. The tech world knows me as a Web & Mobile Developer at MOREAN, but my journey is so much more than that.</p>

  <!-- Personal Life -->
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Who's Behind the Screen</h3>
  <p>At 43, I feel more vibrant than ever. My lovely wife, Daiana and our incredible twins, Luciano and Nicolás, are the support system that fuels my passion. We're an inseparable team.</p>

  <!-- Career Path -->
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">My Road to Tech</h3>
  <p>I got my start in a corporate IT department in my early twenties. Life was busy, juggling a full-time job and not having enough time or resources for formal education. But that didn't stop me. I committed myself to learning, and over time became a key IT resource.</p>

  <!-- Academic Life -->
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">The Educator in Me 👨🏻‍🏫</h3>
  <p>For almost 15 years, I've dedicated myself to educating students across diverse public institutions. I've taught a gamut of topics from computer repair to AutoCAD. This isn't just fulfilling for me; it's been a symbiotic relationship of shared learning.</p>

  <!-- Objectives -->
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">Where I'm Headed 🧑🏻‍💻</h3>
  <p>I'm currently focused on mastering full-stack development, especially in the realm of JavaScript frameworks. My goal isn't merely to code but to contribute to groundbreaking projects.</p>

  <!-- Hobbies & Interests -->
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4 mb-2">When I Unplug 🎸</h3>
  <p>When I step away from the keyboard, you can find me strumming my electric guitar, inspired by legends like Jason Becker and Yngwie Malmsteen, or enjoying the great outdoors while fishing.</p>
